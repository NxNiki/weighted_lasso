## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
fun.y = function(x){
    y = 2*x + 1 + rnorm(n = length(x), mean = 0, sd = 5)
    return(y)
}

n = seq(from = 10, to = 10000, by = 10)
r = rep(NA, length = length(n))

for (idx in 1:length(n)) {
    x = seq(0,1, length = n[idx])
    #print(2*x+1 + rnorm(n = n, mean = 0, sd = 1))
    y = fun.y(x)
    
    cor = cor.test(x,y)
    r[idx] = cor$estimate
}




```

## Including Plots

as the number of samples grows, the variance of r is smaller, and approches the true value:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(n, r, col = "red", cex = .1)
```
# lasso regularization:
```{r}
x = seq(from = -100, to = 100, by = 1)
x2 = seq(from = -100, to = 100, by = 1)
y = abs(x)
y2 = .05*(x-50)^2 + 20

plot(x, y, cex = .1, col = "red")
lines(x, y2, cex = .1, col = "green")
lines(x, y+y2, cex = .1, col = "blue")

```
# ridge regularization:
```{r}
x = seq(from = -100, to = 100, by = 1)
y = x^2
y2 = .05*(x-50)^2 + 20

plot(x, y, cex = .1, col = "red")
lines(x, y2, cex = .1, col = "green")
lines(x, y+y2, cex = .1, col = "blue")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
